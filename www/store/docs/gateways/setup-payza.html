            Payza has a superb test sandbox system, which is located at:<br>
 <a href="https://sandbox.payza.com/center/signup.aspx" onclick="window.open(this);return false">https://sandbox.payza.com/center/signup.aspx</a><br><br>
 When you sign up for a sandbox account a personal and business account are created for you. Log into the business account and configure the same as above.<br><br>
 Note that if the sandbox system is down, you can use the IPN option in your live account. Setup is the same as the sandbox, but make sure test mode is enabled
 until you are sure it is working.
